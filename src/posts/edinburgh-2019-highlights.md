Just back from a few days up in Edinburgh for our first Fringe. Highlights included:

*  Starting with the [Crystal Rasmussun](https://twitter.com/tomglitter) show at the Underbelly Cowgate - a proper full-on SHOW show which set the benchmark and slightly overshadowed everything we saw afterwards
* Seeing both [Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Rachel Fairburn's](https://www.facebook.com/AllKillaNoFillaPodcast/) WIP separate shows
* Finally getting to watch my friend [Che Burnley](https://twitter.com/cheburnley) do standup at the alternative Black Comedy Showcase about 10 years after he started 
* [Seeing Siblings deal with a tiny man at their front row](https://twitter.com/siblings_comedy/status/1159910374914891776)

I'm knackered from two days - being there for a whole month must be like running the Barkley Marathons.
