I was working on this list a while back but it seems a bit more pertinent now as lots of people have more time on their hands and could do with some cheery reading. It's worth noting that most of these lists can be supported either through Ko-fi, Patreon or a subscription so please chip in if you can afford to.

## **Jobs**

**Sian Meades - [Freelance Writing Jobs](<https://mailchi.mp/69d207801f23/freelancewritingjobs>)**

Sian has a weekly email listing paid writing jobs and also grants and emergency funding. She also has the fabulous [Domestic Sluttery](<https://www.domesticsluttery.com/>) list.

**Anna Codrea-Rado - [The Professional Freelancer](<https://theprofessionalfreelancer.substack.com/>)** 

Aimed at all freelancers but with a lean towards writers, Anna has a lot of thoughtful articles on the freelance career. Comes in a free and paid subscription version.

## Writing

Craig Mod - Ridgeline <https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/> - Roden - <https://craigmod.com/explorers/>

Not one but two mailing lists centered around walking, photography and Japan. Craig wrote [a review of the Panasonic GF1 years ago that kicked my photography in a new direction](<https://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest/>).

**Joe Muggs - <https://tinyletter.com/Joemuggs>**

A weekly chunky list of music, tv and culture reading that will send you down many a rabbit hole.

## Noises in yer ear holes



**[Podcast Bangers](<https://tinyletter.com/Podcast_Bangers>)**

Just back from hiatus, Hannah Verdier has a regular summary of new and old podcasts that might have passed you by.

**[You are listening to...](<https://tinyletter.com/idontlikewords>)** 

This has been around in some form or another for years - ambient sounds mixed with police scanners and radios from the US. I use this to zone out to whilst working on illustrations.
