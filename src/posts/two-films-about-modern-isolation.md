Today is Super Saturday, when pubs are warily opening up after months of lockdown isolation and some sort of tenuous victory can be claimed.

As an alternative here's two films that pair up nicely about modern isolation which have a sense of optimism and cheeriness about them.

**The Solitary Life of Cranes by Eva Weber**

This is quite a daydreamy short film from ten years ago about 24 hours in the life of crane operators in London. It's quite meditative and full of patterns that people see every day and can be taken for granted. You could probably write some lengthy piece about blah blah viewer/voyeur blah blah modern environment etc but I like it because it's very chill and a well put together film.

There doesn't seem to be any way of buying it at the moment but the director has (either inadvertently or not) left the film semi accessible - [you can watch the whole thing here](https://vimeo.com/22830975/1145f481ad).

**Thursday by Matthias Hoegg**

Similar to the Solitary Life of Cranes, this is another day in the life of people in a city story. I really love the animation style on this - it's stuffed full of patterns and rhythms. It's also very chill.
