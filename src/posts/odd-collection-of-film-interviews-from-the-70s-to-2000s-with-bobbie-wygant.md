<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/43371615">Bobbie Wygant Interviews Alexander Godunov for &quot;Die Hard&quot; 1988</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/erikclapp">EC Films</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I've found a series of videos of movie press interviews archived on Vimeo that are fantastic. The interviewer Bobbie Wygant comes across as a genteel Texas grandma (which she probably is as she's in her 90's) and the interviews themselves are fairly unedited - some start with her and the interviewee aimlessly chatting while the crew set things up.

The most interesting part is that even though they're for a light entertainment show, there's plenty of detail in them that shames the modern press junket style interview which are PR'd to the last inch. There's also a whole range of chats about movies from the 80's onwards that have kind of drifted and disappeared in the cultural memory (when did you last think of Burt Reynolds in Paternity?).

They also feature a fabulous array of people in pastels, massive specs (Michael Caine) and snuggly knitwear.

There's more of the unedited stuff in sidebar on the following videos and a bucketload of even more here <http://bobbiewygant.blogspot.com/> and here <https://vimeo.com/user44820822>.
