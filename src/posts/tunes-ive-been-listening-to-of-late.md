I've recently found a decent Youtube channel playing loads of lo-fi house and bits what sounds like late 90's / early 2000's era Rephlex label tracks - lots of lazy house piano with rubbery 303 wobbling away in the background. 

What makes it work even better is they've combined the tracks with old camcorder footage that they've trawled up from somewhere which combines it into a weird fake nostalgia fest. There's a Lithuanian dance contest, people filming themselves on road trips, loads of ravers gathering in Ireland somewhere, [that Doncaster Rave video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM3xf87CbIQ). It's very warming and nice to have on in the background whilst working.

I think I originally found it indirectly through this video which lead me down a rabbit hole of looking for [The New Dance Show](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+new+dance+show).
