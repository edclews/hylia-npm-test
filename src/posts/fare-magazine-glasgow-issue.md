Glasgow is the latest edition of [Fare Magazine](https://www.faremag.com/), a cracking little food and travel mag that explores cities. I picked up a previous one covering Charleston through my old [Stack magazine subscription](https://www.stackmagazines.com/), the pile of which I'm still working my way through.

There's a good mixture of photography and illustration in it that explores the socialist history and community roots of the city, as well as covering the arts and food in a non-wanky, over-designed way. There's some neat touches like the inner front pages made to look like a Tunnock's Caramel wrapper.

It's a good read for a quiet Sunday after noon sit down, not too long stories and a lack of showy look-at-this showing off. Plus like all magazines the pages have a great smell that hangs about. 

There's an example article from the first Istanbul issue here:  <https://www.faremag.com/fare-journal/the-operator>
