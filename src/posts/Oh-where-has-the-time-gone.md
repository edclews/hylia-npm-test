Turns out between the last update and this one I did actually write several new posts BUT never had the time to finish or write them. I will be putting more time into this though.

* I've finished my photography MA - the hand-in is literally this week but I stuck it in a week earlier. What a time sink this was!
* I'm finishing off some book reviews that I started but a few opinions have changed about them so rejiggling.
* Started a new short term contract working on design and accessibility - more on that to come.
* I'm looking forward to a decent break.
* Turns out I've forgotten how Github and Markdown works so need to get my head warmed up to those again.

While all that's bubbling in the background, have a look at my [photography portfolio here](https://www.edclewsphoto.co.uk/) or [my design / photography / illustration summary site](https://www.edclews.co.uk/) that I had to knock up quick while looking for a job.
