We went to have a gawp at the [Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow](https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/kelvingrove-art-gallery-and-museum) whilst up there for a weekend and only by chance when going to the cloakroom did we find out there was a [Linda McCartney photography retrospective](https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/event/1/linda-mccartney-retrospective) on there.

I have to admit, apart from her band photos, I didn't know much else about her work but there turns out to be a broad range. This retrospective has an absolute stack of images showing her family life, their farm in Scotland, commercial work and travel photography. My favourite was the picture of a young James McCartney arsing around with a napkin balanced on his head.

The exhibition is in its last week but will move to[ Liverpool in April 2020](https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/linda-mccartney/index.aspx) with a more Liverpool / Wirral centred collection.

The Kelvingrove itself is definitely worth the visit as well. It's stuffed to the gunnels with stuff - animals (dead ones), paintings (Dali's and French impressionists as well as Scottish painters), statues and modern arty bits. Get there early if you want to see it in a bit of peace as it's free and quite child friendly.
