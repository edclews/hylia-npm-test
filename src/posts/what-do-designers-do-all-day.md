I'm always interested in what other designers do and how their careers develop, especially during their day to day.

[This is a series of (mostly) anonymous interviews by Shane Hudson](https://interviews.shanehudson.net/) in which designers at different sized companies talk about their work. It's interesting to see the size of the teams and how they all fit together.

I'm also reading [How They Got There by Khoi Vinh](https://howtheygotthere.com/). It's a mix of interviews with designers that mostly started their careers in the early-ish days of the internet (late 90s to early 2000s). No matter what stage in your career you're at, it's a worthwhile read that will help you reflect on where you are now and where you want to be. I've definitely got  a lot out of it and it's helped me look back over my meandering job journey with some satisfaction.
